                        We took ship instead of airplane. 
                        Japan looks similar my country, but different culture and environment. 
                        It located more lower latitude than my country.
                        So weather and spices of plant were new to me. </p>

                        When my husband got a first decent job, 
                        Company sent to him in Santa Monica,CA for conference. 
                        We went together with my first girl. 
                        It was our first worry-free traveling.
                        Because we've been so long beaten down by life, during 9 years, which was my husband student journey .
                        That traveling gave us some sense of relief.
                        We still have financially and emotionally struggle, but not that time. One of my happiest moment
