                        We took ship instead of airplane. 
                        It looks similar my country, but different culture and environment. 
                        It located more lower latitude than my country.
                        So weather and spices plant were new to me. </p>

                        When my husband got a first decent job, 
                        Company sent to him in Santa Monica,CA for conference. 
                        We went together with my first girl. 
                        It was our first worry-free traveling.
                        Because we've been so long beaten down by life during 9 years, which was my husband student journey .
                        That traveling gave us some sense of relief.
                        We still have financially and emotionally struggle, but that we are never forget that moment.
